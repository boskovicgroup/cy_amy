# Synthetic applications of photochemical decarbonylation of oxetanone and azetidinone

Repo related to the Boskovic group disclosure of photochemical formation of carbonyl ylides and azomethine ylides.

Folder "NMR_sdf" contains structured data files with NMR shifts associated with the proton and carbon nuclei in the compounds reported in the manuscript.

Folder "cif_files" contains three structures derived from the diffraction of X-rays on suitable single crystals.

Folder "gamess_models" contains output log files from energy optimizations of ground state and excited state structures, transition states, conical intersections for 3-oxetanone, N-Boc-3-azetidinone, and cyclobutanone. 

Folder "quantum_yield" contains the MatLab code and the underlying data to generate Figure 3 in the main text of the manuscript.
